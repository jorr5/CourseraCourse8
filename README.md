# CourseraCourse8
This R file corresponds to the Course 8 Project Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup.
The project focuses on observing 6 participants performing an activity while wearing exercise monitoring devices. 
We examine how well the activity trackers assess how well someone performs an exercise.

Main concepts explored are using the technique of dividing a dataset into test, train, and validation to make a predictive model.
I used the Tree Method and the Random Forest Model and evaluated against the test set to quantify accuracy of predictions.
The Random Forest Model produced the most accurate results at 99% accuracy.
